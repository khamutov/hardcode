# Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation Challenge

## Goal

Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems.

Challenge is implementing Raft from scratch.
